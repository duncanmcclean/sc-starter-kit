## Simple Commerce Starter Kit

<!-- /statamic:hide -->

The Simple Commerce Starter Kit is a great starting point to build bespoke e-commerce sites. You can either build on top of this Starter Kit or simply use it as a reference point for working with Simple Commerce's [Antlers Tags](https://simple-commerce.duncanmcclean.com/tags) (**recommended**).

Before deploying to production, please remember to purchase a license from the [Statamic Marketplace](https://statamic.com/simple-commerce).

## Cargo

**Simple Commerce will soon be replaced with [Cargo](https://builtwithcargo.dev)**, the natural evolution of Simple Commerce. It takes everything you love about Simple Commerce and makes it better in every possible way.

Cargo is currently in alpha and will be released shortly after Statamic 6. If you're starting a new project, you should probably [use Cargo instead](https://builtwithcargo.dev/docs/installation). Existing projects can continue to use Simple Commerce, which has been updated to work with Statamic 6. However, you should plan to [migrate to Cargo](https://builtwithcargo.dev/docs/migrating-from-simple-commerce) when possible.

## Quick Start

You can quickly create a new site using the [Statamic CLI](https://github.com/statamic/cli).

```
statamic new artisan-bakery duncanmcclean/sc-starter-kit
```

**And that should be you setup! ðŸŽ‰**

## Front-end stack

Tailwind CSS & Alpine.js are used out-of-the-box but feel free to change them out if you're more comfortable with something else. For building CSS & JS, this starter kit uses [Vite](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/vite). It's configured to compile one CSS file and one JS file.

-   `resources/css/site.css` -> `public/css/site.css`
-   `resources/js/site.js` -> `public/js/site.js`

There's also a few commands you can run to compile your assets for various environments.

-   `npm run dev` - runs a local watcher
-   `npm run build` - to build your CSS & JavaScript, ready for production

## Inspired by Peak

Parts of the Simple Commerce Starter Kit have been inspired/borrowed from the popular [Peak starter kit](https://github.com/studio1902/statamic-peak). If you're not familiar with Peak, I'd highly recommend checking it out.

If you want to use all the features in Peak, you should install the Peak Starter Kit first, then [install Simple Commerce on top](https://simple-commerce.duncanmcclean.com/installation#content-installing-into-an-existing-site).
